        <p>
            Feeling my way through the darkness<br>
            Guided by a beating heart<br>
            I can't tell where the journey will end<br>
            But I know where to start<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            They tell me I'm too young to understand<br>
            They say I'm caught up in a dream<br>
            Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes<br>
            Well that's fine by me<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            So wake me up when it's all over<br>
            When I'm wiser and I'm older<br>
            All this time I was finding myself, and I<br>
            Didn't know I was lost<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            So wake me up when it's all over<br>
            When I'm wiser and I'm older<br>
            All this time I was finding myself, and I<br>
            Didn't know I was lost<br>
        </p>
