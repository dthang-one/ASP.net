        <p>
            Where there's a will, there's a way, kind of beautiful<br>
            And every night has its day, so magical<br>
            And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle<br>
            That can't be defeated<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            For every tyrant, a tear for the vulnerable<br>
            In every lost soul, the bones of a miracle<br>
            For every dreamer, a dream, we're unstoppable<br>
            With something to believe in<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Monday left me broken<br>
            Tuesday, I was through with hoping<br>
            Wednesday, my empty arms were open<br>
            Thursday, waiting for love, waiting for love<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank the stars it's Friday<br>
            I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday<br>
            Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday<br>
            I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love to come around<br>
        </p>

        <span>Where there's a will, there's a way"--a fact that he finds "kinda beautiful."<br>
        He's celebrating the idea that if someone really wants something, that person can find it if he or she tries hard,<br>
        similarly to how "every night has its day, so magical." We don't have to stay in our bad times;<br>
        we can fight through to something better if we really want it.<br>
        <br>
        But what do we use to make that change? Aldred sings that "if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle<br>
        That can't be defeated." <br>
        I don't think that this is a romantic love because, other than the word "love," there's no mention of any romance whatsoever.<br>
        If I had to guess, I'd say that "Waiting for Love" is about a search for higher love--something deeper.<br>

        <span> This song somehow make me feel like: we should live life to the fullest, because no sooner <br>
            then you think it could be over and if you haven't done anything for yourself,<br>
            just to be you, you might not have anything to be remembered by, or remember<br>
            anything yourself. Be who you are because you are awesome and no one can change<br>
            that. A quote I always stick by is "Be yourself, because an original is worth more<br>
            than a copy." I don't know who it's by but I love it.<br>
